    "This configuration is for setting up a vector search index in Elasticsearch, which is a popular open-source search and analytics engine. Here's an explanation of the different parts of the configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `\"settings\"`: This section defines the settings for the Elasticsearch index.\n",
    "   - `\"index.knn\": \"true\"`: Enables the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) plugin for vector similarity search.\n",
    "   - `\"number_of_shards\": 1`: Specifies the number of shards (partitions) for the index. In this case, it's set to 1.\n",
    "   - `\"knn.algo_param.ef_search\": 512`: This parameter controls the trade-off between search accuracy and speed for the kNN algorithm. A higher value (512 in this case) increases accuracy but may slow down the search.\n",
    "   - `\"number_of_replicas\": 0`: Specifies the number of replica shards for the index. In this case, it's set to 0 (no replicas).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `\"mappings\"`: This section defines the mapping (schema) for the index.\n",
    "   - `\"properties\"`: This subsection defines the fields (properties) of the documents that will be stored in the index.\n",
    "     - `\"vector\"`: This field is of type `\"knn_vector\"`, which is a specialized field type for storing dense vectors (embeddings) for vector similarity search.\n",
    "       - `\"dimension\": 1536`: Specifies the dimensionality (length) of the vectors that will be stored in this field.\n",
    "       - `\"method\"`: This subsection configures the specific algorithm and parameters for the vector search.\n",
    "         - `\"name\": \"hnsw\"`: Specifies the algorithm name, which is \"Hierarchical Navigable Small World\" (HNSW), a graph-based algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search.\n",
    "         - `\"engine\": \"faiss\"`: Specifies the underlying engine used for vector search, which is \"Facebook AI Similarity Search\" (FAISS), a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.\n",
    "         - `\"space_type\": \"l2\"`: Specifies the distance metric used for vector similarity calculations, which is the Euclidean (L2) distance in this case.\n",
    "     - `\"text\"`: This field is of type `\"text\"`, which is a standard text field for storing and searching textual data.\n",
    "     - `\"text-metadata\"`: This field is also of type `\"text\"`, likely used for storing additional metadata or information related to the text or vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration sets up an Elasticsearch index with a single shard and no replicas, enabling the kNN plugin for vector similarity search. It defines a `\"vector\"` field for storing dense vectors (embeddings) with a dimensionality of 1536, using the HNSW algorithm from the FAISS engine and the Euclidean distance metric for similarity calculations. It also includes two text fields, `\"text\"` and `\"text-metadata\"`, which can be used to store and search textual data and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of configuration is commonly used in applications that involve vector similarity search, such as semantic search, recommendation systems, or other machine learning tasks that rely on dense vector representations."
